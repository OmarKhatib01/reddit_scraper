Not to mention the whole Russian collusion thing where Trump was installed because he would just hand things over to his masters *(Putin's cock-holster, vulnerable to pee-tape blackmail, big loans owed to ""oligarchs"")*.

Why does Putin wait for Corn Pop to get in office before getting aggressive? Why is NK saber rattling again? Why is China flexing so hard? It isn't because of anything we were told the last 4 years. They see our current bungling of foreign affairs. They smell the senility and weakness on our CiC. Americans in Kyiv need to note what happened in Kabul and react accordingly.
